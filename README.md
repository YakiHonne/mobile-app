## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: >= 3.0.1 < 4.0.0
- **Dart SDK**: Included with Flutter
- **IDE**: Android Studio, VS Code, or IntelliJ IDEA
- **Platform-specific requirements**:
  - Android: Android Studio with Android SDK
  - iOS: Xcode (macOS only)
  - Web: Chrome browser
  - Desktop: Platform-specific build tools

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YakiHonne/mobile-app.git
   cd mobile-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add required API keys and configuration (see `.env.example` if available)

4. **Generate launcher icons**

   ```bash
   flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
   ```

5. **Generate native splash screens**
   ```bash
   flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
   ```

### Running the App

**Development mode:**

```bash
flutter run
```

**Run on specific platform:**

```bash
flutter run -d android
flutter run -d ios
flutter run -d chrome
flutter run -d windows
flutter run -d macos
flutter run -d linux
```

**Build for production:**

Mobile builds are obfuscated, so pass `--obfuscate --split-debug-info` and
upload the resulting symbol map to Sentry afterwards — otherwise crash/ANR
stack traces come back unreadable (`<unknown>` frames).

```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk --release --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/symbols

# Android App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/symbols

# iOS
flutter build ios --release --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/symbols

# Upload the Dart debug symbols to Sentry (reads config from pubspec.yaml + sentry.properties)
dart run sentry_dart_plugin

# Web
flutter build web --release

# Desktop
flutter build windows --release
flutter build macos --release
flutter build linux --release
```

To add a new language:

1. Add translation files in the appropriate directory
2. Run code generation: `flutter pub run build_runner build`
